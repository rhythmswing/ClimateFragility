\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We proposed a novel probabilistic framework to evaluate a state's fragility. Based on this, we analyzed the direct and indirect of environmental factors on fragility, and the interaction between environmental and human factors in their joint contribution to fragility. 

We also proposed a temporal framework to forecase future environmental change. Our model found that moderate economic growth balances the trade-off between fast economic development and environmental damage in the long term.
