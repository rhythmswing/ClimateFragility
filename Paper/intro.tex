Quantifying the fragility of states based on human factors, such as the FSI score has been extensively studied by researchers and instutitions, such as in \reminder{cite some important works here. } However, these models does not consider the impact of environmental factors. For example, deterioation in natural environment may contribute on regional instability and violence~\reminder{some references required here}. As environmental factors are important in determining a state or a region's sustainability, merely considering human factors is clearly insufficient.
