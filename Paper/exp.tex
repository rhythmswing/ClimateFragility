\subsection{Calculation of Fragility Score}
In order to calculate fragility score defined in Section~\ref{sec:model:frag}, we need to identify, a priori, which states are fragile and which states are environmentally unstable. 
In order to achieve so, we determine that a state is fragile, i.e. $\FFF=1$, if its FSI score is higher than a certain threshold $F_0$, and a state is environmentally fragile, i.e. $\EFF=1$, if its EPI score is lower than a certain threshold $E_0$. 
The thresholds are chosen differently for each year, because the indexes of different years aren't necessarily calculated using the same methodology.
Therefore, thresholds for each year are chosen to guarantee that the fragile states and environmentally fragile states occupy approximately $30\%$ of the states, respectively. As such, each state's status of fragility and environmental fragility is approximated by HSI and EPI indexes. Furthermore, we use the 12 indicators used in the calculation of FSI, specified in \reminder{specify somewhere}, as components of human factors $\HFF = \left[ h_1\ldots h_12 \right]$.

Hence, all variables needed for the calculation of our fragility score, including $\HFF, \EFF, \FFF$, are specified for each state. Logistic regression was run as described in Section~\ref{sec:model:frag} to obtain fragility score of each state. Finally, we visualize the relationship between the score and the two indexes in Figure~\ref{fig:exp:frag_relation}.

   \caption{Relationship between Fragility Score $\FFS$ and FSI and EPI.} 
   \label{fig:exp:frag_relation}
\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:exp:frag_relation:epi} shows that states with lower EPI indexes have higher scores in general, but the variance is high when the environment is worsened. Figure~\ref{fig:exp:frag_relation:fsi} shows that states with higher FSI obtain higher scores. 
The figures show that HSI majorly determines $\FFS$, while EPI acts as an adjustment.

\vpara{Consistency Test.}
In order to show that $\FFS$ is a reasonable criterion of states' fragility, we need to make sure that a state which is completely better than another state, i.e. with higher EPI and lower FSI, obtains lower $\FFS$. In this case, we call that the two states are \emph{inconsistent}.
We therefore define the average reverse number order $r$: 
\begin{equation}
   r\triangleq \frac{1}{2N}\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{r_k}{N}  = \frac{1}{2N^2}\sum_{k=1}^N r_k
   \label{eqn:exp:reverse_order}
\end{equation}
where for the $k$th state in the dataset, $r_k$ is the number of other states that inconsistent with it.

The $r_k$ calculated for the indexes in the year of 2017 is $0.01764$, which is sufficiently low to bring confidence to the fragility score $s_f$.

\subsection{Indirect Effect of Environmental Factors}

To measure the indirect effect of environmental factors, we modeled several regression models in Section~\ref{sec:model:indirect}. Specifically, we choose the EPI index and FSI index described in Section~\ref{sec:exp:prep} to represent the environmental factors $\EFF$ and human factors $\HFF$, respectively. The indexes are scaled and centralized, such that a comparsion of coefficients is meaningful.
\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
   \begin{tabular}{|l|ccc|} \hline
      Variable & $\EFF$ & $\HFF$ & $\EFF\times\HFF$ \\ \hline
      Coefficient & 0.17 & 0.91 & 0.06 \\ \hline
      P-value & 0.31 & 0.00 & 0.69679 \\ \hline
      Significant & No & Yes & No  \\ \hline
   \end{tabular} 
   \caption{Moderator variable model of human factors.}
   \label{tab:exp:moderator}
\end{table}

\vpara{Moderator Effect.}
The regression parameters and their p-value is listed in Table~\ref{tab:exp:moderator}. Lower p-value indicates that the original hypothesis that was tested is insignificant. We determine that if the p-value lower a certain threshold, $0.05$, we would reject the hypothesis. Since our hypothesis detailed in Section~\ref{sec:model:indirect} is that the coefficient is zero, p-value lower than $0.05$ would show that the effect of the corresponding variable is significant.

Table~\ref{tab:exp:moderator} shows that the moderator effect is not significant; therefore we would reject the hypothesis that the human factors act as a moderator of the relation between the environmental factors and the fragility.

\begin{table}[htbp]

    \begin{tabular}{|l|cccc|} \hline
        Variable & Model & Coef. & p-val. & Sign.  \\ \hline

        & $\FFF\sim\HFF+\EFF$ & 0.2272 & 0.00773 & Yes \\ \hline        
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Mediator variable effect of human factors. The column Model tells the regression model, in which the left hand of $\sim$ is the dependent variable, and the right hand are the independent variables used in the regression model.}
    \label{tab:exp:mediator:general}
\end{table}
    
\vpara{Mediator Effect.}
Table~\ref{tab:exp:mediator:general} shows the result of the test of the mediator effect of human factors, represented by the FSI index. The results show that the effect of human factors on fragility is significant, and that the effect of environmental factors on fragility is significant, by corresponding coefficients in models $\FFF\sim\HFF+\EFF$ and $\HFF\sim\EFF$. In both models of $\FFF\sim\EFF$ and $\FFF\sim\HFF+\EFF$, the effects of human factors on the fragility are significant; furthermore, the absolute value of the coefficient is reduced by approximately $0.4$ once $\HFF$ is introduced. Therefore, the human factors act as a mediator variable, through which the environmental factors influence fragility. Furthermore, model $\FFF\sim\EFF$ shows that environmental factors also influence fragility directly. As such, a statistical proof of the mediator variable model in Section~\ref{sec:model:indirect} is complete.

We are also interested in how the influence of environmental factors propagate through human factors. Therefore, we choose the 12 indicators used in the calculation of HSI index~\reminder{citation}, and construct a new regression model: $\FFF\sim\EFF+h_1+\ldots+h_12$, where $h_i$ is an individual factor. However, not all of the indicators are significant, therefore we attempt to find best subset of indicators that are significant by stepwise regression: at each step, we remove from the regression model an indicator that is statistically insignificant. Since previously removed indicator could be significant in the new model, we add at each step a previously removed indicator that has become significant to the regression model, if there is one. We stop when there is no insignificant indicator to remove and no significant indicator to add. 

The used subset of indicators, their coefficients and significance are shown in Table~\ref{tab:exp:mediator:subset}.
Experiments show that the impact of environmental change propagates mainly through demographic pressures, human flight and brain drain, and human rights. It also flows through group grievance in a less significant manner. Furthermore, it goes through Economy and refugee flows slightly.

\end{table}

\vpara{Conclusion on Indirect Effects.} Above experiments show that:
\begin{itemize}
   \item The environmental factors and human factors both directly influence fragility;
   \item Environmental factors also influence human factors, and human factors act as a mediator variable to pass the influence of the environmental factors to fragility 
\end{itemize}
Which is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:model:indirect:mediator}.

\subsection{Temporal Model}
\label{sec:exp:temporal}
The temporal prescribed in Section~\ref{sec:model2} is implemented by these following steps:
\vpara{Variables Preparation.}
    The following basic indicators are chosen as basis for our temporal model, and can be found on the data bank of the World Bank~\reminder{specific?}.
    \begin{itemize}
       \item Gross Domestic Production (GDP) (constant 2010 US dollar) 
       \item Gross Domestic Production Annual Growth Rate
    \end{itemize}
    We denote GDP at time $t$ by $G_t$ and its growth rate $R_t
    \triangleq\frac{\Delta G_t}{\Delta t} = \frac{G_t-G_{t-1}}{G_{t-1}}$. $E_t$ is the EPI index in time $t$. Oftentimes variables are scaled, i.e first centralized by its mean, and normalized by its standard variance.
    The scaled version of these variables are written as $\overline{G_t}, \overline{R_t}$, and $\overline{E_t}$, while the scaling is performed according to the set of data at all time steps prior to and including $t$.

\vpara{Forcasting GDP.}
The GDP Growth is modeled by ARIMA in Section~\ref{sec:model2}.
Furthermore, we choose three values of $\mu$ to represent different speed of economic development: $\mu=0$ for stable, $\mu=0.3$ for moderate, and $\mu=0.5$ for fast.
The prediction of GDP growth rate in these three settings is in Figure~\ref{fig:exp:future:gdp}.


\vpara{Predicting EPI.}
    Now every variable is well prepared for the prediction of EPI index, as in Figure~\ref{fig:exp:future:epi}. The specifics are as below.
    The temporal equation is expressed as:
    \begin{equation}
       E_t = \beta_0 E_{t-1} + \beta_1 \log(G_t) + \beta_2 R_t + \beta_3 \overline{R_t}\times\overline{G_t} + \beta_4\overline{R_t}\times\overline{R_t}
       \label{eqn:exp:temporal:regression}
    \end{equation}
    The parameters are determined by standard linear regression, with resutls listed in Figure~\ref{tab:exp:temporal:params}. The signs of coefficients show the effects of variables:
    
    \begin{table}[htbp]
        \centering
        \begin{tabular}{|l|ccccc|} \hline
            Variable & $E_{t-1}$ & $\log(G_t)$ & $R_t$ & $\overline{E_{t-1}}\times\overline{G_t}$ & $\overline{E_{t-1}}\times\overline{R_t}$
            \\ \hline
            Coefficient & 0.35 & -6.79 & -0.21 & -0.71 & 0.07 
            \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
        \caption{Parameters for our Temporal Model.}
        \label{tab:exp:temporal:params}
    \end{table}
    \begin{itemize}
       \item Good environmental performance tends to become better;
       \item Fast GDP Growth tends to damage environmental performance; however, when EPI is sufficiently high, the damage is neutralized.
    \end{itemize}
    \reminder{weakness: reflects the specific status of a country in a certain period.}

    \label{fig:exp:future}
\end{figure}

\vpara{Trade-off between Development and Environment.} 
From Figure~\ref{fig:exp:future:epi}, we see that in stable development setting, Mauritius does not reach a environmental fragile status within the range of 50 years.

However, faster economic development brings instablizing factors. Under moderate and fast development settings, where $\mu$ is $0.3$ and $0.5$ respectively, Mauritius would be environmentally fragile within 50 years. The faster the development, the sooner it becomes fragile.

We then consider another hyperparameter $\alpha$ proposed in Section~\ref{sec:model2}, used to represent the investment of a country to control for environmental instability possibly brought by economic development.

Remember that $\alpha$ does not change the predicted value of $G_t$, $R_t$ per se. Instead, when predicting EPI, the values of variables used in Eqn.~\ref{eqn:exp:temporal:regression} is adjusted: $R_t\leftarrow R_t-\alpha$, $G_t\leftarrow (R_t-\alpha)G_{t-1}+G_{t-1}$. Therefore, it is considered the annual governmental investment as percentage of GDP to improve environmental performance.

We visualized the minimum $\alpha$, i.e. percentage of GDP as investment to protect environment, that is required to guaranteed that the state's EPI is larger than 50 in 50 years. The result is as in Figure~\ref{fig:exp:tradeoff}.
\begin{figure}[htbp]
   \centering
   \includegraphics[width=.4\linewidth]{figs/tradeoff} 
   \caption{Trade-off between Development and Environment}
   \label{fig:exp:tradeoff}
\end{figure}

Clearly, when the economic development is sufficiently large, the government need to invest a certain amount of money to ensure environmental stability.

We are interested in the cost of environmental protection. The investment is calculated as $\alpha G_t$ for each year $t$. For simplicity, we assume that the state gains $t\mu G_t$ for each year $t$ for fast economic development, since theoretically, the economic development contributes accumulatively $\mu$ percent of GDP growth each year.

Therefore, annual cost of environmental protection is $(\alpha-t\mu)G_t$.

Figure~\ref{fig:exp:tradeoff} shows a trade-off between fast economic development and environmental protection. \reminder{need to show when the contribution is larger than the side effect.}
