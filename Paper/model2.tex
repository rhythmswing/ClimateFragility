\subsection{Temporal Model}
% In Section~\ref{sec:model1} we analyzed in depth the relationship between the three variables: the environmental factors $\EFF$, the human factors $\HFF$, and the fragility score $\FFF$. 
In order to better model climate change, we further consider time as a variable, and investigate how climate change would have influenced the fragility of states. Specifically, we choose China as an example state, and illustrate how and when it would reach a tipping point
